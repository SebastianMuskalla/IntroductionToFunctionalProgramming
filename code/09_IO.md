Introduction to functional programming in Haskell
=================================================

9: IO in purely functional languages
------------------------------------

### Problem

IO (input and output) inherently has side effects and hence is hard to do in a purely functional way

### Solution 1 - Give up pureness

Many functional languages (like SML - standard ML) solve the problem by not being pure

For example, SML has a `print` command that prints strings to STDOUT.

**Problem:** This breaks the guarantees of functional programming and can lead to unexpected behavior

```sml
(* prints HAHA *)
print "HA\n";  print "HA\n";

print "\n\n\n";

(* prints HA only once - x IS NOT evaluated twice *)
let val ha = (print "HA\n")
in  ha; ha end;

print "\n\n\n";

(* prints HA twice - ha () IS evaluated twice *)
let fun ha () = (print "HA\n")
in  ha (); ha () end;
```

### Solution 2 - Uniqueness types

Use so called "uniqueness types".
Objects of these types can only be used once.

The main guarantee that a pure function should satisfy is that `f(x)` always stays the same, no matter where this expression is placed in the code

If the compiler prevents us from writing `f(x)` twice, we can do side effect without breaking the guarantee

Look at the following program in the language Clean

```clean
module hello

import StdEnv

Start :: *World -> *World
Start world
    # (console,world2) = stdio world
    # console2         = fwrites "Hello World.\n" console
    # (ok,world3)      = fclose console2 world2
    | not ok           = abort "Cannot close console.\n"
    | otherwise        = world
```

The `*` in `*World` turns `World` into an uniqueness type.

An object of type `*World` can only be used once.

For example, after using the parameter`world` in the line `stdio world` to get a console that can be used for writing to STDOUT, we cannot reuse `world`.
Instead, we get a new object `world2` which then can be used once.

**Problem:** No real problem (may even be more efficient in practice than the Haskell solution), but conceptually not as nice as the Haskell solution


### Solution 3 - IO type constructor + monads

Type `IO a` representing computations that - if we would execute it - returns a value of type `a`\
e.g. `IO String` - computation (potentially with side-effects) that would give us a `String` if we would executed it\
(Think of it as a recipe for a `String`)

In Haskell, we are pure and CANNOT actually execute it.\
However, the compiler/interpreter CAN first compute the "IO recipe" (in a pure fashion) and then execute it (which is impure).\
Because Haskell has lazy evaluation, we can in fact first compute the first step of the "IO recipe", then execute, then compute the next step, and so on.

With this trick, Haskell is pure, at least conceptually\
(but: the actual implementation is impure)

#### Some IO functions in Haskell:

`putStrLn :: String -> IO ()`\
take a String, print it to the console, return `()` as a dummy result

`getLine :: IO String`\
return the String entered by the user

However, if we try to combine these two functions, e.g.\
`echo = putStrLn (getLine)`\
we get a type error: expected String, got IO String

#### Bind

We need an operator that allows us to combine IO functions.\
To be precise, it should have signature\
`IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b`.

This operator exists under the name `>>=` (pronounce: bind),\
and the following code is valid:\
`echo = getLine >>= putStrLn `.

The types match:
* `getLine` is of type `IO String`
* `putStrLn` is of type `String -> IO ()`
* `>>=` is of type `IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b`
* Hence, `echo` is of type `IO ()`

It may seem that `>>=` allows us to obtain the result of `getLine` (in an impure fashion) and then feed it into `putStrLn`.\
In fact, that is what the name `bind` is referring to:\
We bind the result of the "command" on the left-hand side of bind (in our example: `getLine`) to a name, then use that name to call the function on the right-hand side of bind.\
(Consider the version `echo = getLine >>= (\x -> putStrLn x)` of the above code.)

However, conceptually, bind is not impure code. The operator `>>=` simply acts as a *recipe combiner*:\
Given an `IO a` (a recipe for a value of type `a`), and a function `a -> IO b` (a function that takes an `a` and returns a recipe for a value of `b`),\
it produces a recipe that, if we would actually execute it would
* execute the "command" on the left-hand side, obtaining an `a`
* feed the result of type `a` into the function on the right-hand side,
* obtain a command of type `IO b`, and then
* execute this command.

If we let the compiler/interpreter execute the result of a usage of bind (e.g. the above "command" echo), we get impure behavior.\
The operator bind itself and the expressions that can be created using it are pure though.

#### More details

One can think of a value of type `IO a` as a function of the shape\
`RealWorld -> (a, RealWorld)`.

It takes the state of the impure real world and produces a new state of the world in addition of the desired result of type `a`.

However:
1. the value of type RealWorld CANNOT be exposed,\
    i.e. there is no function
    `getWorld :: IO a -> RealWorld`
2. there is no function
   `getOutOfIO :: IO a -> a` (*)

From the GHC source code / documentation:
> The IO Monad is just an instance of the ST monad, where the state is the real world.\
> RealWorld is deeply magical.\
> We never manipulate values of type RealWorld; it's only used in the type system, to parameterise State.

(We will explain what the ST monad is later)

(*) Actually, such a function exists (`unsafePerformIO`), but it should never be used other than maybe for testing purposes.\
    It breaks many Haskell guarantees, including the type system.\
    With the bind operator and monads at our disposal, we will not need this function.
